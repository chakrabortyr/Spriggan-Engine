# Spriggan-Engine
A 2D topdown RPG Engine written in Java.

The Spriggan Engine (named for the wicked creatures of Celtic Folklore) is a hearkening back to the RPGs of the late 80s, who were in turn inspired by rougelikes such as NetHack. The Engine is being developed for a personal project, but is designed to be fairly modular. To minimize dependencies on hardcoded elements while avoiding the complexities of a script language, all game data will be loadable from JSON or CSV files.

The code of the engine is available under our own "Common Sense License". Any reuse of the code is expected to preserve the header and our name.
